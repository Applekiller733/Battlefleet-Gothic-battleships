# Battlefleet-Gothic-Battleships

## Description

This is a Python battleships game project built by me. I have expanded on the initial battleships idea by introducing certain elements such as

  -multiple types of weapons for the ships

  -multiple ship types depending on size, which dictate the weapons equipped

  -QoL changes (such as a random layout generator for the player's ships or allowing the player to chain-write hits on the board)

  -multiple 'class' types dictating available ships at startup

Despite this, what the project lacks is a proper AI (currently AI simply randomly assigns hits on board) and a proper GUI, as the entirety of the game takes place inside of the console.
